						<p class="lead"> Rebecca's thoughts</p>
						<ol>
							<li>  Etsy is easy to use</li>
							<li>	Listing cost of $0.20 for four
								months and 3.5% of the selling price are affordable</li>
							<li>	Sellers are well-displayed,
								have hundreds of followers, and are well-reviewed.</li>
							<li>	Items are fairly priced and most items seem to sell quickly and easily</li>
							<li>	The site attracts a large market of buyers for unique, well made items like Rebecca's.</li>

						<p id="step1""><p class="lead">Etsy's thoughts</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Etsy shows top sellers with crisp photos, good profiles, top # of followers, reviews, and customers first
								on home page.  The success of others should prompt new users to register and sell or buy</li>
							<li>User product clicks are cached so similar items are shown to them while they persuse the site and on future
								visits. The draws them back</li>
							<li>Provide registration button, open shop button, and seller button to draw eye.  User can click any.</li>
							<li>Upon click, a window pops up prompting for username and email address.  User will fill out form an click submit.
							<li>Upon submition, a another popup window will ask for currency type selection with an easy pull down menu.
								The currency for their country is already selected, so the user only has to click ACCEPT.  If user tries to
								skip this step, no more windows are provided to continue registration  </li>
							<li>Upon currency selection, user is brought to a page where they can easily add products, costs, shipping,
								and payment information</li>
							<li>This registration process is as simplified as etsy can make it,
								while forcing the user to complete all information in order to register.</li>
